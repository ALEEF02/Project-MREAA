I am currently beginning on this project. A full guide as well as code will be posted here in the coming months.

## Update July 10th
I am still working on this project, but 3 different people which I have asked to 3D print my main ring gear have fallen through (all for different reasons). I am currently working on getting my own 3D printer to print the part myself. Hopefully this project should be finished by August.

## Update October 2nd
Just about done! Need to print one more gear for the azimuth motor, which I've had to reprint multiple times due to mis-sizing on the internal hole. I am very behind schedule due to reopening of schools and my part-time job. Finished version should be (hopefully) published by month end. :D
