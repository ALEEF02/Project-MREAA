I am currently beginning on this project. A full guide as well as code will be posted here in the coming months.

## Update July 10th
I am still working on this project, but 3 different people which I have asked to 3D print my main ring gear have fallen through (all for different reasons). I am currently working on getting my own 3D printer to print the part myself. Hopefully this project should be finished by August.
